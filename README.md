CHRONIC KIDNEY (RENAL) DISEASE PREDICTION USING ML

Problem Definition:
	In today's era everyone is trying to be conscious about health even through the workload and busy schedule, one gives attention to the health when it shows any symptoms of some kind. In order to that, the field of biosciences have advanced to a larger extent and have generated large amounts of information from Electronic Health Records. This have given rise to the acute need of knowledge generation from this enormous amount of data. Data mining methods and machine learning play a major role in this aspect of biosciences. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as they always do. A family history of kidney diseases or failure, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes may lead to CKD. This is a lasting damage to the kidney and chances of getting worse by time is high. The very common complications that results due to a kidney failure are heart diseases, anaemia, bone diseases, high potassium and calcium. The worst case situation leads to complete kidney failure and necessitates kidney transplant to live. An early detection of CKD can improve the quality of life to a greater extent. This calls for good prediction algorithms to predict CKD at an earlier stage. We have a wide range of machine learning algorithms employed for the prediction of CKD. The techniques we will be using here are data pre-processing, exploratory analysis of data, model optimization, various classifiers to predict CKD, and finally we will be choosing the best classifier which can predict CKD in a very early stage. 

Dataset description:
	The dataset used here is the chronic kidney disease dataset form the UCI repository. In that dataset there are 400 patient records. Also they include 25 attributes, 11 are numeric and 13 are nominal and one is class attribute. Here the information of dataset uses the patientâ€™s data like age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells etc. The detailed attribute information is given below.
